## RPG - Dragon Repeller Game

Welcome to the Dragon Repeller game repository! This project is a simple, browser-based RPG where players must defeat a dragon to save the town. The game involves navigating various locations, fighting monsters, upgrading weapons, and managing health and gold.

### Project Overview

#### HTML (`index.html`)
The HTML file sets up the basic structure of the game interface, including:
- **Player Stats**: Displays current XP, health, and gold.
- **Game Controls**: Provides buttons for navigating the game (e.g., going to the store, cave, or fighting the dragon).
- **Monster Stats**: Displays information about the current monster being fought.
- **Narrative Text**: Shows descriptive text guiding the player through the game.

#### CSS (`styles.css`)
The CSS file styles the game interface, ensuring a cohesive look and feel:
- **Dark Theme**: Uses a dark background with contrasting text for readability.
- **Layout**: Centers the game container and defines the appearance of various elements.
- **Button Styles**: Enhances the buttons with hover effects and distinct colors.

#### JavaScript (`script.js`)
The JavaScript file contains the core game logic and functionality:
- **Player Management**: Tracks XP, health, gold, and inventory.
- **Navigation**: Allows players to move between different locations like the town square, store, and cave.
- **Combat System**: Handles fighting mechanics, including attacking, dodging, and running away from monsters.
- **Store Transactions**: Enables purchasing health and weapons, and selling items.
- **Game States**: Manages win/loss conditions and special events (e.g., easter eggs).

### Key Features

- **Random Events**: Includes chances for weapon breaks and special mini-games.
- **Inventory Management**: Players can upgrade and sell weapons, affecting combat effectiveness.
